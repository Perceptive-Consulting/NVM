             <h1 class="heading3 margin-top15">Company history if you really want to know. </h1>
             	<p><strong>Ashantidutch Property Letting Ltd,</strong>  was established in April 2010 following on from the success of my first company <strong>Ashantidutch Property Letting</strong>. <br /><br />
 
The first company was established to provide housing in Staffordshire, that said I had a desire to help as many people as possible to gain decent accommodation where ever they wanted to live.
As I looked back on my life, I realized that due to an unstable home life, I vowed that, as soon as I was old enough to leave home I would, and at the age of 18, I left home.
However, I was fortunate in that I trained as a carpenter and apprenticed with for a company that had a portfolio of rental properties,  and so I rented a flat from this company for 5 years. In short I eventually saved enough money to buy my first house and I lived there for 16 years.

             	<p>However, this home owner period was not without its challenges, as the recession took hold in the 90's I fell into arrears with my mortgage to the tune of <span>£</span>9,000 
             	and I had aggregated depts Of £26,000 and during that period my house was nearly re-possessed 4 times, in short, this did not happen and I survived to tell the tale, If you would like help to stop re-possession then click on the link above this will take you to my other website that contains useful links and information that could save your home, above all take action and be brave. </p>
