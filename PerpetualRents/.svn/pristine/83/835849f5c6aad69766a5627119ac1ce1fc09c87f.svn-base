              <p>Dear landlord if you're here, then it could be because you're exited about getting market rents with no voids for the next 3 years. 
              If you are still not sure that you want a passive income with hassle then please see the videos on the about us page.
               But remember you worked hard enough to buy and refurbish the property, so don't you think you deserve a 3 year rest,
                I do so don't delay register now.</p>
